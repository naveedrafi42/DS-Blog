## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. Often data science work can get messy and requires attention to detail, does background music help?
2. How are different programming languages trending? Which ones should you learn?
3. What really matters when it comes to job satisfaction?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The project has 3 main folders and a readme file. Following is a the breakdown of the most important ones:

1. Notebooks
  - Project Notebook Q1
  - Project Notebook Q2
  - Project Notebook Q3
2. Data
  - SO dev survey
    - survey results schema (csv)
    - survey results public (scv)
    
All code required for this project is encapsulated within the notebook cells including util functions. Markdown cells and comments are used to describe the flow of the code.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@naveedrafi/need-to-write-a-lot-of-code-background-music-is-here-to-help-6f49b6e7179e)

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Big shout out to Josh Bernhard for describing each step of the process and preparing the tests along with other utils for this lesson. You can find more of his interesting work [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774)

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
